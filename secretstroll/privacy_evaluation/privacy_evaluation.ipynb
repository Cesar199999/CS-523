    "We assume that 2 successive request send in the same cell count has 1 visit in the cell.\n",
    "We assume the connection is encrypted so the adversary cannot eavesdrop and read the packets but we assume that if the adversary have access to any data so it have access to all presented in section 2.1 and that the adversary can do data analysis. More concretely the service provider is the adversary and search to know information about indivual users.\n",

    "With a given ip we can count the number of time the user with this ip visited a given cell or given type of POI to learn what the hobbies of the user are and where he lives. We could also infer with timestamp to learn where the user work and what are his work hours. After this we can compare between different users if they are visiting the same place at the same time and learning which users are knowing each other. "
